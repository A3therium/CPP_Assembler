# CPP_Assembler
A VERY bad interactive interpreter I made for AQA's assembly language to help understand it. Please do not use this for anything important. It includes preposterous amounts of else if statements, and is probably the least processor efficient thing I have ever made.

I have only uploaded this to allow my classmates to use it. The code is awfull, I made it in around 2 hours, please do not use this unless there are no other options.
